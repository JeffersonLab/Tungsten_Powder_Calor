We describe the design, construction and test of a Tungsten Powder/Scintillating Fiber Calorimeter prototype. The design and construction follow 
a novel technique developed at Jefferson Lab. Advantages for the use of such calorimeters include the use of smaller fibers given improved energy
resolutions, compactness, freedom for chosen the geometry of light collection and reducing the number of fibers to be read out for a given resolution.
We also discuss possible improvements to the design and construction technique.
